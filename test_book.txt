[Jim [Gallien]] had driven four miles out of [Fairbanks] when he spotted the [hitchhiker
standing in the snow beside the road,] thumb raised high, shivering in the gray [[Alaska]
dawn]. He didn't appear to be very old: eighteen, maybe nineteen at most. A rifle protruded from the young man's backpack, but he looked friendly enough; a hitchhiker with
a [Remington semiautomatic] isn't the sort of thing that gives motorists pause in the fortyninth state. [Gallien] steered his truck onto the shoulder and told the kid to climb in.
The hitchhiker swung his pack into the bed of the [Ford] and introduced himself as
[Alex]. "[Alex?]" [Gallien] responded, fishing for a last name.
"Just [Alex]," the young man replied, pointedly rejecting the bait. Five feet seven or
eight with a wiry build, he claimed to be twenty-four years old and said he was from
<2>
[South Dakota]. He explained that he wanted a ride as far as the edge of [[Denali] National
Park], where he intended to walk deep into the bush and "live off the land for a few
months."
[Gallien], a union electrician, was on his way to Anchorage, 240 miles beyond [Denali]
on the [George Parks Highway;] he told Alex he'd drop him off wherever he wanted.
Alex's backpack looked as though it weighed only twenty-five or thirty pounds, which
struck [Gallien]—an accomplished hunter and woodsman—as an improbably light load for
a stay of several months in the back-country, especially so early in the spring. "He wasn't
carrying anywhere near as much food and gear as you'd expect a guy to be carrying for
that kind of trip," [Gallien] recalls.
The sun came up. As they rolled down from the forested ridges above the [Tanana
River], Alex gazed across the expanse of windswept muskeg stretching to the south.
[Gallien] wondered whether he'd picked up one of those crackpots from the lower fortyeight who come north to live out ill-considered [Jack London] fantasies. [Alaska] has longbeen a magnet for dreamers and misfits, people who think the unsullied enormity of the
[Last Frontier] will patch all the holes in their lives. The bush is an unforgiving place,
however, that cares nothing for hope or longing.
["People from Outside,"] reports [Gallien] in a slow, sonorous drawl, "they'll pick up a
copy of [Alaska] magazine, thumb through it, get to thinkin' 'Hey, I'm goin' to get on up
there, live off the land, go claim me a piece of the good life.' But when they get here and
actually head out into the bush—well, it isn't like the magazines make it out to be. The
rivers are big and fast. The mosquitoes eat you alive. Most places, there aren't a lot of
animals to hunt. Livin' in the bush isn't no picnic."
It was a two-hour drive from [Fairbanks] to the edge of [[Denali] Park]. The more they
talked, the less [Alex] struck [Gallien] as a nutcase. He was congenial and seemed welleducated. He peppered [Gallien] with thoughtful questions about the kind of small game
that live in the country, the kinds of berries he could eat—"that kind of thing."
Still, [Gallien] was concerned. [Alex] admitted that the only food in his pack was a tenpound bag of rice. His gear seemed exceedingly minimal for the harsh conditions of the
interior, which in April still lay buried under the winter snowpack. [Alex's] cheap leather
hiking boots were neither waterproof nor well insulated. His rifle was only .22 caliber, a
bore too small to rely on if he expected to kill large animals like moose and caribou,
which he would have to eat if he hoped to remain very long in the country. He had no ax,
no bug dope, no snowshoes, no compass. The only navigational aid in his possession was
a tattered state road map he'd scrounged at a gas station.
A hundred miles out of [Fairbanks] the highway begins to climb into the foothills of the
[[Alaska] Range]. As the truck lurched over a bridge across the [Nenana River], [Alex] looked
down at the swift current and remarked that he was afraid of the water. "A year ago down
in [Mexico]," he told [Gallien], "I was out on the ocean in a canoe, and I almost drowned
when a storm came up."
A little later [Alex] pulled out his crude map and pointed to a dashed red line thatintersected the road near the coal-mining town of Healy. It represented a route called the
[Stampede Trail]. Seldom traveled, it isn't even marked on most road maps of [Alaska]. On
Alex's map, nevertheless, the broken line meandered west from the Parks Highway for
forty miles or so before petering out in the middle of trackless wilderness north of [Mt.
McKinley]. This, Alex announced to Gallien, [was where he intended to go.
<3>
[Gallien] thought the hitchhiker's] scheme was foolhardy and tried repeatedly to
dissuade him: "I said the hunting wasn't easy where he was going, that he could go for
days without killing any game. When that didn't work, I tried to scare him with bear stories. I told him that a twenty-two probably wouldn't do anything to a grizzly except make
him mad. [Alex] didn't seem too worried. Til climb a tree' is all he said. So I explained that
trees don't grow real big in that part of the state, that a bear could knock down one of
them skinny little black spruce without even trying. But he wouldn't give an inch. He had
an answer for everything I threw at him."
[Gallien] offered to drive [Alex] all the way to [Anchorage], buy him some decent gear,
and then drive him back to wherever he wanted to go.
"No, thanks anyway," [Alex] replied, "I'll be fine with what I've got."
[Gallien] asked whether he had a hunting license.

[Ken Thompson], the owner of an Anchorage auto-body shop, [Gordon Samel], his
employee, and their friend [Ferdie Swanson], a construction worker, set out for the bus on
September 6, 1992, stalking moose. It isn't an easy place to reach. About ten miles past
the end of the improved road the [Stampede Trail] crosses the [Teklanika River], a fast, icy
stream whose waters are opaque with glacial till. The trail comes down to the riverbank
just upstream from a narrow gorge, through which the Teklanika surges in a boil of white
water. The prospect of fording this /affe-colored torrent discourages most people from
traveling any farther.
[[Thompson], [Samel], and [Swanson]], however, are contumacious Alaskans with a special
fondness for driving motor vehicles where motor vehicles aren't really designed to be
driven. Upon arriving at the Teklanika, they scouted the banks until they located a wide,
braided section with relatively shallow channels, and then they steered headlong into the
flood.
"I went first," [Thompson] says. "The river was probably seventy-five feet across and
real swift. My rig is a [jacked-up eighty-two Dodge four by four with thirty-eight-inch
rubber] on it, and the water was right up to the hood. At one point I didn't think I'd get
across. [Gordon] has a eight-thousand-pound winch on the front of his rig; I had him
follow right behind so he could pull me out if I went out of sight."
Thompson made it to the far bank without incident, followed by [[Samel] and [Swanson]
<7>
in their trucks]. In the beds of two of the pickups were light-weight all-terrain vehicles: a
three-wheeler and a four-wheeler. They parked the big rigs on a gravel bar, unloaded the
ATVs, and continued toward the bus in the smaller, more maneuverable machines.
A few hundred yards beyond the river the trail disappeared into a series of chest-deep
beaver ponds. Undeterred, the three Alaskans dynamited the offending stick dams and
drained the ponds. Then they motored onward, up a rocky creek bed and through dense
alder thickets. It was late afternoon by the time they finally arrived at the bus. When they
got there, according to [Thompson], they found "a guy and a girl from [Anchorage] standing
fifty feet away, looking kinda spooked."
